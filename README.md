# Danny Liu - Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website.

## How to use
1. This website is a single-file HTML application using React and Tailwind CSS via CDN.
2. It requires no build step (no npm install, no webpack).
3. To view it, simply open `index.html` in any web browser.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Upload `index.html` and this `README.md` to a GitHub repository (e.g., `dannyliu-design.github.io`).
2. The site will be live at `https://dannyliu-design.github.io`.
